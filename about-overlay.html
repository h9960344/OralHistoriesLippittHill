                In 1959, Lippitt Hill, one of the oldest black neighborhoods in Providence — called by locals at the time “The East Side”— was slated for demolition. The result of racially motivated urban renewal, the project displaced hundreds of people, closed their businesses, and largely erased the vibrant community that once existed there. In 2017, Stages of Freedom brought together members of the community to tell stories of life on Lippitt Hill — their words can be viewed here.
