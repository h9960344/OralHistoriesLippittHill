    "Dialogue":    "Sylvia:    Good afternoon, I’m Sylvia Ann Soares.  When I was about four years old, I lived on Bates St.  Bates St. is hard to describe because it’s not there now.  But if you’re standing in front of Staples in the University Heights, and you look over behind it sort of to the right, it came down from Camp St. and came down right about there, and then it took a left turn and came down Lippitt St.  I then moved down there to 17 Lippitt St., Lippitt St. was located right where the entrance to University Heights plaza off North Main St. is, except that they cut out the land to put University Heights Plaza in.  So if you will also look over past Santander Bank, you will see that their land is higher, and that land actually came sloping down.  Our house was near the bottom and it would’ve been where today the Starbucks is--who knows what’s going to be there later?  There’s a driveway on that side.  The few houses down there, you had to go up the cement steps to get to the house.  So our house would’ve been up in the air over that driveway if it was still here now.\n\nLippitt St. went all the way up to Camp.  Billy Osborne lived on Lippitt St. before they went to Olney St.  Georgana Park, who is our friend, also lived about a block or so up from what is North Main St.  Her father had a massive garden.  His three-decker was pushed back a lot and on Sunday mornings he would get flowers and put them on the picket fence so that people going to church to could take flowers to church.  And they could also work with him about getting the vegetables in the garden.\n\nRay:    Tell us the decades.\n\nSylvia:    So I was born in 1941.  I’m 75.  But now what happened with me was that I went to Doyle Avenue School.  Doyle Avenue School is not there anymore, but it was standing exactly where the East Side Apartments are on Doyle Ave.  I was there only until the third grade.  For the fourth grade, I ended up somewhere else, at a boarding school in Woonsocket.  So I never came back until high school, when I came back to Carrington Avenue just above Camp St. \n\nRay:    Last question Sylvia.  Did you have a sense of community as a child there?\n\nSylvia:    Yeah.  It was a very strong community.  Some of those houses—if you went to visit people, you walked up the back steps—you could eat off the stairs because people’s homes were immaculate.  Of course everyone knew everyone else and if you did something, at home they knew about it.  When I was there I remembered the fish men coming round and ringing the bell and the cart.  And the ice cream man.  [East Siders:    “Rag man”].  I want to let somebody else talk, and maybe talk about Bates St."

    "Dialogue":    "Jesse:    My names Jesse Bradley the third.  I’m 79.  My mother, like she said, is 104 years old.  She could be here today.  A group went by to see her yesterday and she told some of the stories.  She has pictures.  She was secretary of the East Side Neighborhood Council for years.  Still has her minutes.  This goes back.  She worked at the school department, her mother worked in the church.  It goes on and on.\n\nMy grandfather and my grandmother owned four houses on the East Side until they took them away and told her what they would pay her for them. \n\nRay:    Which church?\n\nJesse:    Olney Street Baptist Church. That was the church that a lot of people don’t know but my mother was one of the people who fought for that church to be located at where it’s at now on Olney St.  Brown University wanted the property.  Olney Street had to fight for it to keep it.  And we’re still fighting to keep it. \n\nRay:    You should tell them.  The church faced Pratt St.  I have a postcard.  It’s a little version of the First Baptist Church in America.  You would think no one would tear that church down.\n\nJesse:    Nope.  We’re 116 years old in December.  I’m still in the church.  Been in the church.  I was the little boy with the suit and tie on that had to be in church.  In every organization I was the chaplain.  I also used to play at the Jewish Community Center.  I have a golf partner I play with who’s an attorney now.  I play with him now because I found out—we had a drugstore on the corner of Camp and Lippitt St.\n\nEast Siders in unison:    Harry’s spa\n\nJesse:    His grandson I play golf with and I didn’t know it was his grandson until we got in a conversation.  I used to work for his granddads.  And we’re friends and he’s my attorney today.  And he’s back on the East Side.  He’s just moved in back of Holy Name Church.  He bought his mother’s house and the new house is in the back. \n\nRay:    Tell us where your father’s houses were.\n\nJesse:    They were on Lippitt St, in the middle of Lippitt.  We call it the bottom portion of Lippitt St.  That’s from North Main to Camp and halfway in-between he owned four houses there.  One of the big deaconesses is from the Olney Street Baptist Church.  As a matter of fact a lot of us are from Olney Street Baptist—we all still stay in the church family here.  Congdon Street Church, Olney Street Church.  We’re still existing and still sisters in the church business. \n\nRay:    What did they pay your father for his houses when they took them?\n\nJesse:    They didn’t pay much at all. \n\nEast Siders in unison:    Not much at all\n\nJesse:    I was very young at the time and we didn’t ask. \n\nVirginia:     Can I just add one more thing?  Remember Dr. Gross?  There were a couple black doctors on the East Side.  We had Dr. Gross on Doyle Avenue.  Right where Carver Courts is now.  Little houses, still there.  He used to be there, we used to go there. \n\nRay:    So tell folks about Dr. Gross.\n\nVirginia:    Oh you get sick, you could go to Dr. Gross’ house.  Or I had a Dr. Mandell who came to my mother’s house.  We never went to the doctors; the doctors always came to us.  We got treated very well.  And it didn’t cost much, let’s put it that way.  If you didn’t have money, they came.\n\nRay:    So tell them what Dr. Gross did. \n\nVirginia:    General practitioner.  But he did anything else that you came for. \n\nRay:    But he had a specialty on the side.  He birthed 3,000 black babies.  I’m not supposed to say that.  3,000 babies.  And he had no hospital privileges.  Miriam wrote him wonderful letters telling him no.  And Rhode Island hospital wrote him nasty letters saying no. \n\nVirginia:    And he was excellent, because we’re here today and we’re old.  We’re young. \n\nAudience:    You said there were two doctors, who was the other?\n\nEast Siders in unison:    Dr. Jackson, he was a dentist."

And not one of our big kids stole off the ice cream man.  The kids, we respected our adults.  If a parent said, “You belong in the house”, you went in the house. \n\nDoyle Avenue School was a community school.  Some went to Jenkins St.  Some went to Summit Avenue.  Some went to Howland Holland??.  I went to Doyle Avenue.  It was a community.  I could tell you all the streets that were on there.\n\nRay:    Where did Howell run to?\n\nDeborah:    There was a lower half that went to North Main St..  Then were was a street called Scott Street which was the Jewish community with the Jewish synagogue there.  Then there was another street called Bell St.  There was a little candy store that was on the corner of North Main and that.\n\nRay:    Who’s candy store?\n\nDeborah:    Tinko’s??.  We had markets.  We had laundromats.  We had things.  We were poor but we didn’t know we were poor.  Dr. Andrew Jackson was a black dentist.  Dr. Gross.  We had a beautician, Grace Butler. \n\nRay:    Where was Grace Butler?\n\nDeborah:    On Olney St.  Two or three houses up from Ruthie Courier’s store.  There was Dr. Gross’ nephew--they lived there. \n\nRay:    Was she in the basement of the house that still has the storefront?\n\nDeborah:    Yes, and my grandmother, Ms. Brown, lived right next door to the beauty shop.

It was the East Side. \n\nRay:    Okay!  What else do you want to add?\n\nDeborah:    It was the Olney Street Church, then it was Mendy’s Funeral Home, and Bailey’s was across the street. \n\nRay:    Mendy’s was where?\n\nDeborah:    On Olney St.  Near Pratt.  And then they moved to Camp St.  And Bailey’s was across the street near North Main.  I know my streets. \n\nRay:    You know, there were all those streets in there which are all gone.\n\nDeborah:    Let me tell you, when you came down, you went to Camp St.—my grandmother lived on Camp St.—and back up Camp St. was a street called Mallett St."

We went to Holy Name School on Camp St.  We belonged to the church there. And there was six of us.\n\nRay:    So Holy Name was racially integrated when you were a kid?\n\nJoanna:    Not really.  It was, but there was only a few of us that was there.  We used to walk to school in the morning, from Clorane St. over to Camp St.  Clorane St. was a dead end street.

We didn’t have to go the beach, we had the pool. \n\nJoanna:    They did arts and crafts.  We even had dance.  Then at the end of the season, we went to Roger Williams Park.  We all had the skirts and stuff on, and the pom poms, and it was all of the playgrounds in the city of Providence, at the end of the year, that did that thing at the park there.\n\nRay:    And what years were those?\n\nJoanna:    What year were those?  ‘50s.

And when I moved to what you call Lippitt Hill I was about one years old.  But it was always called the East Side.  Where Lippitt Hill came from, the Chaffees and them...someone named that area.  Now it’s Mount Hope.  So whoever gives these names, you know. \n\nRay:    Slow down a second.  In the ‘40s, people did not call that Lippitt Hill?\n\nEast Siders in unison:    No!\n\nDorothy:    After they started renovating and tearing down and moving us out, it all of a sudden became “Lippitt Hill”. \n\nRay:    Okay, so we have to find out what year Lippitt Hill…because the city calls it Lippitt Hill on the maps. \n\nDorothy:    That’s the name that they gave us.  They always tried to name us.\n\nRay:    Before that, you were just, “On the East Side, or on Bates St.,” or something.\n\nEast Siders in unison:    East Side.\n\nDorothy:    The East Side was considered Fox Point all the way to Pawtucket.  The lower East Side was from, I’d say, North Main to Hope St.\n\nRay:    So you’re telling folks here what we know to be true—that you start giving these places names and then they’re not part of the East Side.\n\nDorothy:    So we’re still separated.  I moved to 47 Howell St, which was close to the end.  I did go to the Doyle Avenue School.  We lived in the bottom off.  So there was the Napolis—\n\nRay:    Two floor or triple?\n\nDorothy:    Triple.  We lived in the rear.  Near the bottom of the Howell St. there were the Napolis—they were Italian.  There was the yarmulke—well they were Jewish and he owned a store on Lippitt St.  And there was a lady named…\n\nRay:    What kind of store?\n\nDorothy:    A little variety store.  And then there was IyaDevedas??  They had a food stand on North Main and Howell.  There was Scott St. and that was the Jewish synagogue.  And this was all before Doyle Avenue.  So I lived at 47 Howell St. ’til I was 14 years old. \n\nRay:    And does the building still stand?\n\nDorothy:    Oh no.\n\nAn unidentified East Sider:    Nothing stands!\n\nDorothy:    And then we moved to 68 Olney St. for a short while.  I went to Hope High School and after that, I guess two or three years later, redevelopments came. \n\nRay:    But 68 was on the Lippitt Hill side?\n\nDorothy:    Well, my parents were there in 1968 on the University Heights side.  And then redevelopment came in so they had to move across the street, which was 72 Olney St.  That’s Olney and Prospect.  They were a number three-decker home. \n\nRay:    Was this next door to Mr. Penderhughes?\n\nDorothy:    Right next door to Mr. Penderhughes.  The houses are still there, the three-decker houses.  My father was a construction worker.  He worked for A.C. Beals, Turging Construction, and a few others.  And he helped build University Heights.  My father worked construction until he was 70 years old.\n\nRay:    Tell us your father’s name.\n\nDorothy:    His name was Peter Monteiros, Sr.  And what happened was, him and a 26-year-old young man was working on the bottom floor when the top floor caved in on them.  So my father was buried and so was the young man.  My father spent three months in the Miriam Hospital.  The young man he came out with bruises--he didn’t spend that long.  \n\nThe funny part about it is we lived across the street from University Heights and my mother was on the porch when all this commotion happened.  But she didn’t realize that it was her husband that was there until someone came later on and told her.  My father, it took him a while to recuperate because of his age.  But he was a strong man.  He was very strong.  And when he got well he wound up working for the neighborhood P for P. \n\nEast Siders:    Pro Cap.\n\nDorothy:    Where he was helping food and all of that.  And then a young man came in one day to rob them.  And my father in his seventies is fighting him and had a good grip on him.  The only reason my father let go is because my father’s glasses came off.  Whether he got caught or not, I don’t remember.\n\nRay:    And where was Pro Cap located?\n\nDorothy:    This was on Camp St. \n\nRay:    Camp St.?\n\nDorothy:    Camp between Abbott and Forest. \n\nRay:    Oh, way up.\n\nDorothy:    Yeah way up.  Some people went from Howell, Olney St., moved over to Doyle Avenue, Grand View, you know.  As we got more educated and was able to buy homes. \n\nRay:    Did Jeffrey Osborne’s family live two doors or three doors from you?\n\nDorothy:    The Osbornes lived in the 60s. \n\nRay:    I thought that you lived at 72.\n\nDorothy:    I did, on Olney St.  But they lived near the bottom, near Pratt St. and Olney St. \n\nRay:    Half a block away!  So did you know Jeffrey Osborn?\n\nEast Siders in unison:    Yes!\n\nRay:    I’m just trying to get him in here! \n\nDorothy:    Yeah, he knows me by name.  He can call me by name. \n\nDeborah:    He went to school with us.   All of them.\n\nVirginia:    You should’ve told me I would’ve brought pictures!\n\nDorothy:    What’s the church at the bottom of the hill?  St. John’s Cathedral?  St. John’s also had another church which was on the corner of North Main and…Church of the Savior.\n\nRay:    Which was the…\n\nEast Siders in unison:    Black Episcopal Church. \n\nRay:    Now I’m Episcopalian and I’m always embarrassed by this:    The church was segregated.\n \nDorothy:    It was segregated, yeah. \n\nRay:    Now did anybody go to the Church of the Savior?\n\nDeborah:    We did when I was younger.  And then we ended up going to Congdon Street because my grandmother, who lived on Olney St., first she went to Olney Street but then she transferred over to Congdon Steet.\n\nRay:    Now how did you jump from Episcopalian to Baptist?\n\nDeborah:    I didn’t know.  Back then, you had to go to church. \n\nDorothy:    Mrs. Moore-Brown’s father was the minister and plus I think he was the chaplain of Brown University.\n\nRay:    For a short period.  Visiting or something. \n\nDorothy:    Abbey Teller on Prospect St., her father was a chaplain for Brown University.  Abbey Teller--her father was a professor and chaplain at Brown University.\n\nRay:    And was this the big house across from Christian Science…\n\nDorothy:    On Prospect and Meeting St. \n\nRay:    So you’re the first person I’m going to suggest that you have a seat."

I have two plaqued houses. \n\nRay:    And tell me, in the 1940s, did you have a sense of community?\n\nNaomi:    Oh yeah, I lived on 75 Lippitt St.  At that time my father had a barber shop underneath in the cellar. \n\nRay:    Is this up from North Main?\n\nNaomi:    On the lower end.  There was another barber at the bottom.\n\nDeborah:    Mr. Amos\n\nNaomi:    There was another one also. \n\nJesse Bradley:    Mr. Carrie\n\nNaomi:    No, Mr. Carrie was on Camp St. \n\nRay:    How many barbers on Lippitt Hill?  We have to call it that…\n\nNaomi:    Four.\n\nRay:    So there was a barber every two blocks? \n\nRob Dimmick:    Can talk a little bit about the importance of the barber shop in that community? \n\nNaomi:    Well my father used to work for Mr. Carrie and he opened up his own barber shop on Lippitt St., 75.  And then from 75 Lippitt St. he went to Randall St.  No he went to North Main where the fruit market used to be. \n\nDeborah:    Frank’s Fruit Market.\n\nNaomi:    And he went from there to Randall Square, near the Celebrity Club, and then he had a lot of famous people who used to go to the Celebrity Club. \n\nRay:    Such as?\n\nNaomi:    Fats Domino. \n\nVirginia:    They all came to my mother’s house because she sold dinners afterwards and the Celebrity Club all popped in.  Charlie and Ray.  Everybody used to come to our house. \n\nRay:    So who met Duke Ellington?\n\nDorothy:    I did.\n\nVirginia:    I did.  The Arcadia we used to go to.   That Arcadia was the bomb. \n\nSylvia:    My paternal family lived in Fox Point, on John St.  But my uncle Eddie Soares was a pianist and he actually sat in for Earl Father Hynes in the Louis Armstrong Group when he was ill one night.  So people afterwards would go to my grandmother’s, my uncle’s and my grandmother’s, and that was in Fox Point.  And Sarah Vaughan came.  And Deloise??? came.  To our house. \n\nNaomi:    And there was a baking place.  We lived at 92 Lippitt St. at one time and there was a baking place and it was owned by the Sheckman’s and they had horses there.  And we used to cut through that street to go to Doyle Avenue School. \n\nDeborah:    It was a little weird looking street and there was a man, he used to have the junk shop. \n\nNaomi:    Not only that.  My uncle John Santos owned two houses right next to us.  And then there was Blunky’s market.  And she lived upstairs and she had candy.  We used to go in there and buy the Jewish pickles.  She had a big keg with the pickles in it.\n\nDeborah:    Weren’t they two cents at that time?  They were the biggest little things you’ve ever seen. \n\nNaomi:    And then my uncle bought Blunky’s and my cousin, later on, she moved into the store.  Mimi Catlin and Obie Catlin.  And then from there they moved over to Pleasant St. and had a little variety store on Pleasant St.  And then my other uncle, Mr. Santos, that used to live next door--when they moved out they went to 166 Prospect St.  So we all lived right around there, the whole family.  And then I had an aunt that lived up on the top part of Lippitt St. and she moved to Duncan Avenue.  And when she moved to Duncan Avenue she gave me a paper where they wrote something about the black people moving to Duncan Avenue and the white people moving out.  It says, “Denies Negro neighbors’ motive for house sales.”  They didn’t want the Negroes to move onto Duncan Avenue. \n\nRay:    So, to move to the other side of Doyle Avenue, to go to…\n\nNaomi:    Duncan Avenue. \n\nRay:    So the story goes that they’re tearing down the black neighborhood and someone comes and tells the Mayor one day, “These black people have no place to go.”  Because it’s redlined and they can’t live there.  And the Mayor has to call in the realtors.  It’s a long story and I’m not supposed to do the talking. So do you all know the story about Billie Holliday?  She’s at the Celebrity Club and she wants a drink.  You’re supposed to say yes you know the story.  Well, she wants a drink and it’s two o’ clock in the afternoon and she goes into a Polish bar on North Main Street and they inform her that—”Whites only.  And she said, “It used to be.” Now do you remember places being segregated?\n\nVirginia:    Yes.\n\nSome East Siders:    No. \n\nRay:    Well we have two answers.\n\nVirginia:    Not on the East Side, no no.\n\nJoanna:    Oh not on the East Side, no. \n\nDorothy:    Not really.\n\nDeborah:     Not when we were growing up, no.\n\nNaomi:    Not on the East Side.\n\nRay:    So, most, correct me, most of the merchants who are not black are Jewish—\n\nEast Siders:    Italian.\n\nRay:    I was gonna get there!  In Lippitt Hill, next door to where you lived, and everybody shopping in those stores, and there’s no discrimination.\n\nVirginia:    Every Saturday my father and us, we had our little shopping bags and we went to Federal Hill.  And that’s how she shopped and got our food and came back home.  We walked because my father didn’t ride no busses.

The Olney Street Church was not there so Camp St. went all the way to Olney St. at that time.  Along that street were—let’s talk about it—there were drugstores, there was Jewish markets, there was black businesses.\n\nDeborah:    There was a market on the corner of Camp and Doyle called Blue Ribbon.  Next to it was a little variety store.  Next to that was a store of Mr. Piles. \n\nEast Siders:    He was an electrician\n\nDeborah:    Coming on down there was a market on the corner of Camp and Howell called My Three Sons. \n\nDorothy:    There was a First National, and an A&P store on Camp and Howell St. \n\nRay:    Was this a little A&P?\n\nVirginia:     No, a big market.\n\nDorothy:    Yeah, a grocery store."

We grew up, like Joanna said, and went to Holy Name School and Church.  We used to walk to school.  We used to come home for lunch.  I remember Record House to tell you the truth, and dancing at the different clubs.  I remember my dad was in a band.  On Labor Day we went to the band and we still have the beautiful picture of all the Cape Verdean people that came from Boston and Connecticut and came together.  And we danced.  And we had a dinner. \n\nAnd there was a store on what you call—I don’t know what—it was North Main St.  And it was her godmother.  And if you were coming up the street there was a store right on the left and you went a little further and the hall was there.  I wrote down some stuff but this…\n\nRay:    The gas station was in the middle of the street right?\n\nTheresa:    I don’t remember the gas station.  When University Heights came and we were told that redevelopment was coming in and then when they were finished we would get first choices to move back.  And that never happened.  So my Dad bought a house, which we kind of still have, on Jenkins St., and we lived there.  So we walked from Jenkins St. and we went to St. Pat’s high school and we used to come down the hill to go to school.  And St. Pat’s Church was there and it’s no longer there.  It was on Smith St.  But my memories of East Side were happy memories.  Like my sister started to tell you, we were on 10 Clorane St.  We were the third house from Bates St. if you were coming up the hill.  And we were near Ruthie’s store.  We were near Bailey’s Funeral Parlor.  Mendes Funeral Parlor.  Mr. Mendes owned the house that we lived in.  And a lot of other houses that were more or less robbed from his children. \n\nSo I don’t know what else to say, because I was sitting here getting so excited because …\n\nRay:    Well what else do you want to say?  Now I just realized something.  Were there three funeral homes? \n\nTheresa:    There was Bailey’s and Mendes. \n\nRay:    There were two black funeral homes.  And where was Bailey’s?\n\nTheresa:    Bailey’s was on Olney St.  If you were coming up Clorane St. from Bates St., then Bailey’s would be right to the left there.  There was another street which was Burr’s Lane.  That’s still there.  My grandmother used to live on Burr’s Lane.  We used to go up from North Main St. to Burr’s Lane, visit my grandmother, and keep going.  You could go to Pratt St. \n\nRay:    And the house wasn’t at the top of Burr’s Lane then so you could go up to Pratt.\n\nTheresa:    Right.  We would go to—where’s that park we walked to?  Prospect.  Well see, we used to call him Roger.  We went to Roger’s park.  And Joanne doesn’t remember but I know and maybe I shouldn’t say this but we used to help ourselves to pears in someone’s yard.  And they were very good pears.  We have so many beautiful memories.\n\nRay:    Whose yard was it?\n\nTheresa:    I have no idea.\n\nRay:    Because if it was one of the old families that still lived there then you could make amends.\n\nTheresa:    Well I’d be happy to bring them some pears but they wouldn’t be as good as those. \n\nRay:    You knowingly or unknowingly just shared something with the audience. \n\nTheresa:    And what was that?\n\n Ray:    In the early days, on Benefit St. and the like, there were 17 orchards because everybody had an orchard on their land.  And in William J. Brown’s book, he talks about getting arrested for stealing apples on Marand??’s land.  So that would be Bowen.  So the apple orchards went all the way to Olney St. \n\nTheresa:    Well we had pears.\n\nRay:    Oh I’m sorry, the orchards.  I stand corrected.  So would you like to talk a little bit?"

    "Name":    "Meredith Spicer DeBritto",
    "Address":    "Dwight St.",
    "Coordinates":    "41.837672842034344, -71.40173301745206",
    "Dialogue":    "Meredith:    Good evening.  My maiden name is Spicer and my last name is DeBritto, since 1954.  I’m 81 and my first name is Meredith.  My prized possession:    When there was the Celebrity Club, Sugar Ray Robinson practiced before he performed and at the same time, [Klaus Dickens] was right in front or near. \n\nRay:    Tell them who he was.\n\nMeredith:    He had this store.  And it happened in that store that was his name worked this one lady, Madeline Davis.  Her relative was James N. Williams, the head of the Urban League, if any of you remember the Urban League.  So once Sugar Ray Robinson had been practicing at the Celebrity Club but then he needed another record to help him practice.  So he went to Klaus Dickens and the sales girl was Madeline Davis and asked if he could borrow to practice.  When he returned the record, he said, “Thank you so much, and I wish I could thank you” or “What can I do to show my appreciation?” \n\nThat weekend, downtown at the Grace Church in Providence, they were having a celebration of students graduating and I say they being the Urban League.  Madeline Davis said it would be nice--there are three people going to receive an award--and it would be nice if you would present it.  So that’s how I received this from Sugar Ray Robinson.  Looks like 1953, it says.\n\nSylvia:    For what?\n\nMeredith:    For having done well in school.  I was the class president of Nathan Bishop when I graduated, and I was Vice President as a junior at Hope High School and as a senior I graduated from Hope High.  And then with the Urban League, I think I was around 16, and Mr. James N. Williams lived across the street from where I lived on Dwight St.  And just to tell you, the end of Dwight is still there and just to tell you, my grandchildren live there with my daughter and her husband.  One goes to Brown now--our grandchild--and the other one’s at Syracuse as a sophomore.  So when I go up and down the stairs—it’s a cottage—and when I have to go the lav, that’s where it is on the second floor.  But my daughter of course knows how old her mother is so I can go up maybe but when I’m coming down, she’s like, “Mom be careful!”  I say, “I had four kids and I went up and down visiting my parents to the same house.”  But she’s cautious. \n\nAnd then while I was at Hope, I was in the Young Artists Club, and I don’t know if I was the president but Mr. Green was the teacher of the club.  There was the Jewish Auxiliary on Elmgrove Ave. and they were having a program and they asked the Young Aritsts Club and I don’t remember who else but I did go to perform. \n\nAlso, my uncle--who lived at 222 Howell St. as a young man; he and my grandparents and his siblings, my mother--when he left Providence, he was in Erskine Hawkins’ band and during the times that he was in New York...Bands travel but the bottom line was Uncle Bobby Smith, when he wasn’t in Erskine Hawkins’ band, he wrote the song “Tippin’ In”.  And that was very popular at the time.  And I enjoyed visiting him.\n\nI was born in Harlem, on 8th Avenue, but only because my parents were—my dad stayed in the musician’s union even after they came back to Providence.  But I was born in ’36, that means my parents were at that age where they weren’t really planning on marriages.  Because I’m an only child. \n\nRay:    Now remember, only tell as much as you want to.\n\nMeredith:    No, I’m just saying that as a musician that’s where he thought he would maybe do as well as his brother-in-law Bobby Smith in Erskine Hawkins’ band.  It was during the Depression.  They sent me as a three-year-old back to Crescent Park, Riverside where my grandmother paternal lived.  And then when it was time for me to start school, speaking about the East Side, we lived—the first house after my parents came back when I was around 5—we lived at 257 Williams St.  And next door were the Limas.  And one of the males of the family was…I don’t know how many black policeman there were when he came a policeman. \n\nSylvia:    He was the second.\n\nMeredith:    It was at the top of Dwight St.  And until the Olney St. apartment complex was built—maybe it stopped before that.  I don’t know.  But as a youngster living on Dwight St., at the end of Dwight and the top of Lippitt, that’s where they erected a pedestal so that the bands could stand.  And what was nice about that as a young girl at the time, during the day the elderly would have made preserves and they would have tables set up along Lippitt St. and people would purchase, etc.  And then at night they would have a band that Sylvia Ann Soares’ relative was in.\n\nSylvia:    No, but Legs Osborne was in it, and you sang in it. \n\nRay:    Now we’re going to wrap up in the next six minutes.  I want to tell you a piece of politics--because we haven’t talked about any--and find out who knew this.  So, the police force--This is a very interesting problem in this country.  The police force in this country—the police are wonderful, they were never bad, they were never racist, they were never segregated, they were never all white.  You know, and so everything now is perfect.\n\nBut in Providence you couldn’t be a police officer.  And the Mayor got desperate and barely won reelection so he cut a deal with the black community:    if you all vote for me, I’ll give you one black policeman.  And, by the way, I checked today—the police force is only 106 people, so one was a little less than 1% but it was a beginning.  And he got 50-60% of the vote in the black community and he decided to honor his word and the leaders, including Mr. Williams, brought in the person they wanted to have the job, who had some background.  And this is a little classified thing I want to be careful how I saw it—but the community wanted the perfect person to have the job so nothing would go wrong, but also they wanted a person who had a personality who could go down there and be abused and not give it back.  So they spent a lot of time picking a person and they took him down to the Mayor and the Mayor said, “I can’t hire him.  He’s too dark.”  So then they brought their second choice.\n\nAudience:    What year was this?\n\nRay:    1952.\n\nRay:    And remember—I don’t want to talk too much—when I came to Providence there were only 12 black police officers and they weren’t permitted to be in South Providence.  You just giggled at it.  So there were 414 police officers, 12 of them black.  We forget these things, don’t we?"
